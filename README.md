# ElectionAnalysis
Challenge 3:
The purpose of this election audit was to gather information on the counties and the votes. We wanted to see which county had the most votes, the higher percentage of votes and the most voter turnouts. To get all of that information, I reused the code we used to get the total number of votes, the percentage votes and the winning candidate. I created new variables and inserted them in the proper parts of the code to get the correct numbers for the counties. The following is a summary of my analysis:

•	As we saw in the candidate votes, we see that the total number of votes in the election is 369,711 total votes.

•	Of those 369,711 votes, Jefferson County had 38,855 total votes or 10.5% of the votes, Denver County had by far the most votes at 306,055 total votes and 82.8% vote percentage and Arapahoe County with 24,801 total votes with 6.7% of the votes. 
•	As stated above, the county with the biggest percentage and the most votes was Denver County with 306,855 total votes with a vote percentage of 82.8%.
•	As far as the candidates are concerned, the candidate with the most votes was Diana DeGette with 73.8% of the votes with a total of 272,892 total votes. The candidate with the second most was Charles Casper Stockham with 23.0% of the votes with 85,213 total votes. The last place finisher, Raymon Anthony Doane , who finished with the last 3.1% of the votes with a total vote count of 11,606.  
•	As you can see from the breakdown above, the winner of the election was Diana DeGette who ran away with the election with 73.8% of the total votes.  
As we were able to learn from this module, we were able to just simply take the code from the candidate information and simply insert new variables to get the same information on the county votes. We were able to break down the results from candidate votes and employ it on a bigger scale with the counties. This would be a great tool to use in future elections to not only break down candidate and county information, we could with a few modifications see how many votes each candidate got per county to see which candidate the county prefers. From the information we gathered from this module, we could guess that Denver County,which is proably one of the larger counties, voted for Diana DeGette. But without really taking a deep dive into how many votes each candidate per county we really cant draw that conclusion.
